### Deploying

Once you've opened the project in [Codespaces](#github-codespaces), in [Dev Containers](#vs-code-dev-containers), or [locally](#local-environment), 

you can deploy it to Azure.

### Azure account setup

1. Sign up for a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and create an Azure Subscription.
2. Check that you have the necessary permissions:
    * Your Azure account must have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions, such as [Role Based Access Control Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview), [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator), or [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner).
    * Your Azure account also needs `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write` permissions on the subscription level.

You can view the permissions for your account and subscription by following the steps below: 
- Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and click on `Subscriptions` under 'Navigation' 
- Select the subscription you are using for this accelerator from the list. 
    - If you try to search for your subscription and it does not come up, make sure no filters are selected.
- Select `Access control (IAM)` and you can see the roles that are assigned to your account for this subscription. 
    - If you want to see more information about the roles, you can go to the `Role assignments`
     tab and search by your account name and then click the role you want to view more information about.

### [Optional]: Customizing resource names 

By default this template will use the environment name as the prefix to prevent naming collisions within Azure. The parameters below show the default values. You only need to run the statements below if you need to change the values. 


> To override any of the parameters, run `azd env set <key> <value>` before running `azd up`. On the first azd command, it will prompt you for the environment name. Be sure to choose 3-20 charaters alphanumeric unique name. 

Change the Content Understanding Location (allowed values: West US, Sweden Central, Australia East)

```shell
azd env set AZURE_ENV_CU_LOCATION 'westus'
```

Change the Secondary Location (example: eastus2, westus2, etc.)

```shell
azd env set AZURE_ENV_SECONDARY_LOCATION eastus2
```

Change the Model Deployment Type (allowed values: Standard, GlobalStandard)

```shell
azd env set AZURE_ENV_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_TYPE GlobalStandard
```

Set the Model Name (allowed values: gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-4)

```shell
azd env set AZURE_ENV_MODEL_NAME gpt-4o-mini
```

Change the Model Capacity (choose a number based on available GPT model capacity in your subscription)

```shell
azd env set AZURE_ENV_MODEL_CAPACITY 30
```

Change the Embedding Model 

```shell
azd env set AZURE_ENV_EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME text-embedding-ada-002
```

Change the Embedding Deployment Capacity (choose a number based on available embedding model capacity in your subscription)

```shell
azd env set AZURE_ENV_EMBEDDING_MODEL_CAPACITY 80
```

### Deploying with azd

1. Login to Azure:

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

    #### To authenticate with Azure Developer CLI (`azd`), use the following command with your **Tenant ID**:

    ```sh
    azd auth login --tenant-id <tenant-id>


2. Provision and deploy all the resources:

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```

3. Provide an `azd` environment name (like "ckmapp")
4. Select a subscription from your Azure account, and select a location which has quota for all the resources. 
    * Then it will provision the resources in your account and deploy the latest code. If you get an error or timeout with deployment, changing the location can help, as there may be availability constraints for the resources.

5. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to the deployed resource group, find the App Service and get the app URL from `Default domain`.
  
6. You can now proceed to run the [development server](#development-server) to test the app locally, or if you are done trying out the app, you can delete the resources by running `azd down`.

### Security guidelines

This template uses Azure Key Vault to store all connections to communicate between resources.

This template also uses [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for local development and deployment.

To ensure continued best practices in your own repository, we recommend that anyone creating solutions based on our templates ensure that the [Github secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) setting is enabled.

You may want to consider additional security measures, such as:

* Enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud to [secure your Azure resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/defender-for-cloud).
* Protecting the Azure Container Apps instance with a [firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/waf-app-gateway) and/or [Virtual Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli).

### How to customize 

If you'd like to customize the solution accelerator, here are some ways you might do that:
- Ingest your own [audio conversation files](./docs/ConversationalDataFormat.md) by uploading them into the storage account and run the process data scripts.
- You can also scale the solution and process large volumes of data by deploying this to Microsoft Fabric by following the steps in [Fabric_deployment.md](./docs/Fabric_deployment.md)
